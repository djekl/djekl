# Hey! :wave:

**I’m Alan.** I’m a software developer, and certified [Laravel developer][0], with over 10 years’ experience and comfortable working across the entire web stack include front-end, back-end, and with cloud services such as [Amazon Web Services][1] and [Google Cloud Platform][2].

Day-to-day I work with PHP, JavaScript, and related technologies. In my spare time, I’m learning [Python][8], [React][9], and [React Native][10].

I also enjoy helping over developers. Through helping other developers.

I currently work for [Molekula][5] as the lead developer, and <abbr title="Chief Technical Officer">CTO</abbr>. Outside of my day job, I operate a business called [FriendlyDev][6], where I build and operate several client sites, as well as my own products. I am probably best known for developing the XboxAPI service, this is now known as [XAPI][7] for legal reasons.
